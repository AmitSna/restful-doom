# RESTful-DOOM

An HTTP + JSON API hosted inside the 1993 DOOM engine!

RESTful-DOOM is a version of Doom which hosts a RESTful API! The API allows you to query and manipulate various game objects with standard HTTP requests as the game runs.

There were a few challenges:

Build an HTTP+JSON RESTful API server in C.
- Run the server code inside the Doom engine, without breaking the game loop.
- Figure out what kinds of things we can manipulate in the game world, and how to interact with them in memory to achieve the desired effect!

## Base DOOM source port
RESTFul-DOOM is built on top of the awesome [chocolate-doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom) project. I like this project because it aims to stick as close to the original experience as possible, while making it easy to compile and run on modern systems.
